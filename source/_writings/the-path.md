I'm almost there. Three more steps. The path. It's empty. Smells of trees. Lichen. Wetness. It's damp. Nature. Someone is coming. I don't want to see them. I hide. It's an old couple. They're cute. No wait they're not. The lady has a radio attached to her belt, attached to her pants, attached to her. It's loud. Loud as hell. Loud loud loud! I come out of the bushes and scream and BANG. High kick. She's falling down the ravine. The husband opens his big big mouth like a big round "O" and BANG my fist in his teeth. I pull him by the feet, and throw him down the ravine, where he lands on top of his wife.  
  
I smile. I feel great.

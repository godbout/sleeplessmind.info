You'll never get back your time. Money you will. Stuff you will. Fame you will. Time you will never. Use it wisely. For learning things of value. For producing things of value. For helping causes and people you value. That includes you. For uncovering out your own unconscious scars, understanding them and yourself, healing, and pour and spill that new gained love towards you, Life, Nature, your causes, your people. Ignore all the rest. The news. The constant shoutings and arguments. The emotional vomit, quick and shallow. Worthless.

On your deathbed, be proud of how you used your time. Life only happens once.

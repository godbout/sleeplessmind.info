Itâ€™s always tough to strike the right balance between being yourself, and loneliness. The more you grow, the more you push up, the loneliest you get.

Is that the price to pay? 

And more importantly, is it worthy?

But if one is getting lonely with oneself, aren't there some issues to solve there? If one cannot handle their own loneliness, why should anyone else take care of it?  And then become a bandaid. A patch anti-loneliness.

And to ultimately, be thrown in a trash.

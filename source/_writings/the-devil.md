Am I OK? She’s asking.

I don’t think so\...

Should I tell her?

I tell her.

She says she made her choice. But her eyes are teary.

She rushes. I’m trying to hold. She gets angry. She blurs things out.

She pushes me away.

But I think she hurts more than I do.

Is that a waste?

Wake up. Girl. You’re running away from Love. You've just listened to Fear.

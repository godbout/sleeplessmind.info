a pain  
a chest  
beating  
a shower  
a shower  
water  
hot  
pouring and  
pouring  

a tear  
a tear  
a hand  
a need  
a hand  
to protect myself  
from myself  
to protect myself  
from the knife  
to protect myself  
from digging  
a hand  
and pulling  
the dark  
oozing pain  

memories  
memories  
tears  
tears  
the escape  
is hard  
but  
necessary  
because  
i am more  
i am more  
i am all  
and all  
i will  
fly again

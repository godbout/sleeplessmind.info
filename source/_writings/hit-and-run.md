I’m a responsible person. Or at least I usually try to be. But that day, I really ate shit. One of the saddest day of my life. So I gave myself a treat.

For whatever reason-that I deemed valid at the time-I drank. Heavily. And I drove back home. Me. The guy who would never do that.

I couldn’t get the car straight, sometimes I was running over the side path, but I didn’t give a shit. I was ok with being arrested tonight. I was ok with being considered a piece of shit. I’ve fought so many years to be seen as the good guy.

Then I hit something. A dog I think. I checked the rearview mirror, but couldn’t really see clearly. Anyway, I didn’t care.

Next think I know, I’m in front of my bed, and fall asleep like a baby\...

The next day I go for my usual coffee, in my usual place, reading my usual newspaper.

Last night there was a hit and run. Someone hit a 7 years old kid and left the crime scene.

Can you believe it? How can people do that? It’s 2016 for God’s sake.

It happened close to where I was driving, around the same time. 

If I hadn’t been drunk, I might have been able to see something, and help.

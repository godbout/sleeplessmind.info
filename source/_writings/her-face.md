I\... I don't know. Something is not right. Her face.

I love her\...

What? How is that even possible? 
It doesn't make sense. At all.

I'm a rational guy. Right? Does that even exist? We are all emotional. We're animals. Yeah but we have this human part, the one that makes us avoid doing stupid things, stupid mistakes. Why?

But her face. Her lips. Her smile. Her demeanor. Her shyness. Her sweetness.

It kills me.

It doesn't make sense.

My heart. It's floating. Within my chest.

What's happening.

Please.

I close my eyes.

I just got punched in the face. For the second time. 

I didn't see it coming. It hit me hard. Very hard.

I had to knee  
And I vomit  
Until my stomach  
Was inside out  

All I had left to do was cry. I've never cried as much. Rivers. 

The pain is immense. 

But for nothing I would discard it.

Because that means I'm alive.

I was walking up the stairs, minding my own business. 3 guys were walking right behind me. One hit me in the neck, I fell. Then they started kicking me in the face. I bled instantly. I heard my nose cracked. I know it was done.

But strangely I didn’t move. I didn’t even want to. I waited. They kept kicking. I didn’t think why would someone do something like that. I just waited. It hurt.

Then they left, laughing.

I waited there, wet, bloody.

3 minutes after, I tried to crawl. But I couldn’t even.

I could just see. People passing by. No one caring.

Then I fell asleep forever.

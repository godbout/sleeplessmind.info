I don’t care about your gender. I don’t care about your race. I don’t care about the way you look. All I care about, I told him, is whether we connect or not. And the way I connect is my business.

The thing is, I connected with him. But he didn’t know it yet. I think he guessed when I kissed him. He kissed back. Then, no more restrictions.

Because I tell you. I don’t care about your gender. I don’t care about your race. I don’t care about the way you look. All I care about, is whether we connect or not.

Give me your brain, and if I love it, I will love you forever.

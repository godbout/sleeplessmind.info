# the writings
I've recently discovered that I've been insomniac for the past 15 years, according to [_Wikipedia_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insomnia#Non-pharmacological). "Recently discovered" because when I was 14 I thought everybody had to wait 1 or 2 hours to fall asleep. Since that age, I added 1 more hour to fall alseep every year.

My mind makes up stories on its own. What you can read on this website is some of those stories. It's a pure dump of the pictures, the colors, and the emotions that fill my head at the moment. Nothing is arranged to make the essays look good, as I'm not really conscious when they are getting typed. My hands are on the keyboard, and it just happens. 

There are only a few stories printed here, but there have been at least a billion. I just keep being optimistic, every night, that I will be able to fall asleep so I don't get up from my bed. Maybe later, I will write one story a day.

# About 

# me

I'm Guillaume Leclerc. I was born in France and I lived there until the day before my 25th birthday. I've traveled through Asia for a year before settling down in Macau, <time datetime="2008-01-07" class="timeago"></time>. I'm married to a beautiful and crazy artist from Hong Kong. I love art in general. I did some oil paitings and some drawings when I was younger, but my heart definitely belongs to music. I had the chance for 3 years to compose, tour and release an album with [_WhyOceans_](http://www.whyoceans.com/) and to have some really awesome side projects ([_Within These Walls_](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TD4kFIp_pqQ), [_I See You Watching Me While I'm Watching You_](http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150406959032961.363208.51685087960&type=3)) with [_Forget the G_](http://forgettheg.com/).  
I pay my bills by doing web/software/apps development and design by day.

You can find me on [_twitter_](http://twitter.com/#!/godbout) but I barely post anything there. I was using twitter to follow people related to the topics I'm interested in but lately the whole thing feels like war, so now I end up unfollowing a lot of people. But I can still grab some DMs there if you feel like.

The best though is probably to follow me on instagram before Facebook shuts it down: [_@ki_yom_](http://web.stagram.com/n/ki_yom/), or to drop me an email: [_&#103;&#117;&#105;&#108;&#108;&#064;&#115;&#108;&#101;&#101;&#112;&#108;&#101;&#115;&#115;&#109;&#105;&#110;&#100;&#046;&#105;&#110;&#102;&#111;_](&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#103;&#117;&#105;&#108;&#108;&#064;&#115;&#108;&#101;&#101;&#112;&#108;&#101;&#115;&#115;&#109;&#105;&#110;&#100;&#046;&#105;&#110;&#102;&#111;).

# insomnia and more

Insomnia is [_bad_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Complications_of_insomnia.svg), but it also brought me some amazing experiences. 2 years ago in my worst period I was sleeping 1 to 2 hours, every 2 days. I started experiencing hallucinations: walls started moving, trees were calling my name, and invisible girls were crying next to me. I also started losing memory in a strange way: I would be in the street or in a coffee shop and having no idea how and why I was being there, like if my brain had just shut down for a couple of minutes. All by being sober.

But the most amazing has been something I was not able to define at the time: [_ego death_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_death). The connection, the energy, the stillness, the peace of mind, the joy, the confidence, the truth, the light. It is hard to explain but you've probably already experienced it quickly when, in front of such a beautiful landscape, everything seems still and you just want to cry because all you can see and feel is love. I've been living with this feeling for 2 weeks. I feel very lucky to have been able to experience that at that time, and even more to have been able to reach that state later on, while I wasn't sleep deprived. And I believe it is the key to a great future. So I have to thank insomnia for that.

# About

# the website, for the geeks

Basically I fell in love with [_Justin Hileman's website_](http://justinhileman.info/) so my colophon is very similar to [_his_](http://justinhileman.info/colophon/). The website is statically generated by [_nanoc_](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/), the layout is done through [_LESS stylesheets_](http://lesscss.org/) and everything is beautifully hosted by [_Linode_](http://www.linode.com/?r=4d38402454871106521686b453c6758100f1b1d6). The fonts are coming from [_Vic Fieger_](http://www.vicfieger.com/) and are called UnderwoodChampionRegular. They greatly fit the feeling I wanted to give here, though they're missing special characters like the ellipsis and the em dash. All the writings have been typed using [_iA Writer_](http://www.iawriter.com/) from [_iA_](http://informationarchitects.net/) which is one the most beautiful experience I had using a software. I'm pretty sure it adds something special to my writings. Hopefully I don't forget anyone here, but let me know if you find I'm using something from you without the credit. I'll be more than happy to add you.

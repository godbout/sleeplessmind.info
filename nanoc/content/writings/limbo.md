I haven’t hurt that much in a while.

So is this how it feels? Did I really forget for that long?

Where is this coming from?

I’m ok with hurting. I’m not avoiding. Hurt has to be valued. But it has to be worthy too. Not all suffering is necessary.

And I don’t know where this one is coming from\...

I should have it all in my hands. To make my own happiness. Or my own suffering. I choose. But not this one.

Wait.

I see it.

Yes.

I know\...

It is so clear now. I haven’t made a decision yet. And I don’t need more time to make one. So it is just fear. Fear is pain. Unnecessary indecision is pain.
  
But this will all be gone soon.

Because I am not in it anymore.

In the limbo.

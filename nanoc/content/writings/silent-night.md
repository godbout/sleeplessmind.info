I have no idea what just happened. I'm half lying on the ground, there's a big pool of blood. Something resonates inside my head. So hard. I can't make it stop. I feel strong though. Liberated. I feel myself. Everything is silent. There are people around, looking at me. Their hands on their mouth. Agape.

Nobody's moving. Nobody's saying anything.

Now they're staring behind me. I turn my head.

A kick is coming. Fast.

I slowly close my eyes, and pray.

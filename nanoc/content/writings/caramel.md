Her skin has the same color as pale caramel. But she smells better. She smells raw. She moves raw. Half animal, half human.

She has a strong connection to the ground. Something I cannot explain. It has to be seen, it has to be touched.

She cannot be adopted, she cannot be dominated. She will be forever free.  

And this is what makes her so attractive.

I trusted. I cared. Sometimes I'm questioning. Does it all make sense? Is that all worthy? 

You give your trust, and you get owned. What does that teach you?

You can see that you shouldn't give your trust away. Or you can see that you have to learn to filter better. Yes, that is it. To filter better.

My brain knows. But my heart doesn't follow. There's always some latency.

My brain is losing respect for her. But my heart is growing love for her.

Little after little  
Life gets better  
Because there is no other  
Way  

Youâ€™re born without  
Knowing anything  
So what did you  
Except  
You little girl  

Things  
Always take time  
The more you live  
The more you have a  
Chance to learn  
The more you learn  
The stronger  
You become  

So hold up  
Little girl  
Little boy  
Because at the end  
As long  
As you are aware  

Everything  

Will be OK

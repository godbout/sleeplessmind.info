I've been hiking for 3 hours before reaching the bottom of Her. She's majestic. And frightening. 

Can we do something together? I am not sure anymore now. 
I am the one taking all the risks. And even if I'm gone today, She's gonna be there for some thousands of years more. Peaceful, calm, rooted, centered.

I am just one among the others.

I could actually head back now. I don't have to do that. It's not fair. But it seems I don't care much. 

I'm ready to give it all. I'm ready to lose it all.

That doesn't make any sense. And yet, why does this feel so right.

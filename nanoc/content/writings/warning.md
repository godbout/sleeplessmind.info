I feel tired. 

Sleep went well. So this is not the problem. 

Thereâ€™s a lot of empty space around me. Distance to others seems unlimited. 

What used to be sturdy ropes bridging each other now look like delicate threads, close to rupture.

My head is heavy. Loneliness at its peak.

This is a warning. The connection to myself has been lost.

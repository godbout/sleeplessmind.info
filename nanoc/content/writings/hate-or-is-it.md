We were in the middle of something. Deep talk. But then he came out of nowhere, and destroyed everything.

How much can you hate someone? Why? Why does it matter? Isn’t hate just a personal poison? A poison that YOU inflict to yourself?

Will I feel better once I put that bullet between his nose and his forehead?

Will I feel right?

Do I even know what I’m talking about?

Probably not. Because the truth is, I haven’t felt hate for so long that I don’t even know what it is anymore.

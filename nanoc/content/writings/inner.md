There’s that group of people. What a pain. Can’t make a decision, but can’t accept any advice. Need full democracy. Don’t listen to themselves, but keep checking what the majority is thinking in order to affirm their “own” choices.

What a pain. So complicated.

But the simplest way is the inner way. What do you want? State it. Go for it. You don’t need anyone to approve. Not strangers. Not your classmates. Not your colleagues. Not your family. Not your partner. Just you.

Make your choice, and state it. No need to go back and forth. No need to follow the flock. 

It’s all in there. All you have to do is question the right person.

BANG.

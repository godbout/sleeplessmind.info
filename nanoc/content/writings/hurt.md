I had to sit down there, in the middle of the road. I was agape. A taxi stopped next to my head. I puked in front of it. The guy turned his car around. Usually that would have made me laugh hard, but not today.

I don’t understand. Or maybe I do, but I refuse to.

How can one let themselves driven only by their emotions. Like an animal? With not an ounce of decency?

And what about promises. Agreements. Respect. 

Do you need to like someone to respect them? I don’t think so. 

Wait, weak answer. NO. YOU DON’T. That is the real answer.

Disagreeing is one thing, disrespecting is another. Not liking is one thing, disrespecting is another. Feeling rage is one thing, disrespecting is another.

But trust has been broken now.

You crossed the line little bird. And now you’re gonna lose your wings.

This, I can promise.

    <h1>(Poor) Little Boy</h1>
    <p>I was 19 at the time.</p>

<p>Fanny and I were walking around the lake. We liked to meet and talk for hours. We would first cook and eat in her home, and then follow the edge along the water. I think the whole trail takes about 1 hour, but we’d just stop here and there, on a bench, on the grass, and chat. Any subject. But it was always deep.</p>

<p>Then on the other side, we saw a kid. A girl. She was maybe 5 or 6. She was drowning. On the bank were 2 policemen. They didn’t move. Another kid, about maybe 10, a boy, went into the water. Later we would learn that it was her brother. He saved his sister. But not himself.</p>

<p>We ran and screamed. “WHY DONT YOU FUCKING HELP?!! CANT YOU SEE HES DROWNING???!!!”. But they didn’t move. Fanny and I jumped into the water, and brought back the kid on the shore. But he was dead already.</p>

<p>We both stared back at the policemen.</p>

<p>Then they talked.</p>

<p>They said that they were “not trained” to deal with the incident, and decided to wait until the trained officers arrived. Else there might be “legal issues”.</p>

<p>The boy died. The parents cried. The policemen got nothing, not even a warning. They had respected the code of conduct of their job. They didn’t break any rules. They did the “right” thing. They should be proud of themselves.</p>

<p>Fanny and I walked a bit more. We sat down, removed our shoes and dropped our feet into the cold water. We started discussing about morals and ethics. We ate an apple.</p>

<p>So, this is the world we live in.</p>

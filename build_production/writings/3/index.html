    <h1>3</h1>
    <p>She and I were devising a plan to put her into our bed, but we were muddying the waters way more than necessary&#46;..</p>

<p>I didn't actually care whether we would all end up fucking together, I already had my share of crazy experiences. But after she met her, she couldn't refrain herself from dreaming about it. And I could understand. That girl was a knockout, and she had this absolutely loving and bubbly personality.</p>

<p>But if this had to happen, I had to take things into my own hands. Because last week she spent so much time sending her messages through the phone that were so mawkish that I don't even understand how that girl hasn't blocked her yet.</p>

<p>Anyway. I don't want to bother you too much with the details, but it's done, it's happening right now, as I'm talking to you. And while she is finally squeezing one of her nipple to make her wail like a little child, my protruded tongue is getting closer and closer to her nether regions, as I'm planning to make her squirm forever.</p>

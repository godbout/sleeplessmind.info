    <h1>I&#039;m in Japan</h1>
    <p>I'm slowly waking up, completely slouched on a yucky sofa. Again, I have no idea where I am, and what just happened. "It's becoming a habit," I tell myself. And not a good one. Another night of deviant behaviors. Not the first, and probably not the last.</p>

<p>Beads of blood are staining my shirt, all over the bottom area. Some are around my crotch too, but it feels like everything is in its right place so I don't worry too much. Or maybe I just can't, I don't know.</p>

<p>When I decide to raise my head up there's an old dude with white hair two meters away from my face and he's wearing just a thong and getting excited around a dance pole. The coot is glowering at me with his tongue dangling out of his mouth while he's nibbling on his own nipple.</p>

<p>Fuck. But really. WTF is going on.</p>

<p>The whole scene gives me the willies and I can't believe all that shit is real and all I want to do is run away from that place but as soon as I stand up my left leg gives out and I plunge to the floor and my face plummets right into someone else's vomit. I gasp and uncontrollably-and unfortunately-take a deep whiff and right away decide to turn off my nose sensitivity but it's too late and I blatantly reverse all my food intake of the past 3 days-or so it seems-at the feet of the geezer who is still chewing on his left mammary gland. The old cuckoo jerks his chin at me and spit on the top of my head.</p>

<p>The situation seems so absurd that I don't even feel like bawling him out, and I'm just hoping this is all a nightmare and I close my eyes and pray.</p>

<p>And it's only when I open them back that I notice that the old man's body is as trim as a marathon runner.</p>

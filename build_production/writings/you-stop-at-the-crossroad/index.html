    <h1>You Stop at the Crossroad</h1>
    <p>I was crossing the road. As usual, the guy didn’t stop. I had to. But today was not a good day.</p>

<p>I was wearing my Dr. Martens. So I just kicked the door of his fucking car. I didn’t feel any shame. I didn’t feel bad of anything. I just kept moving my way.</p>

<p>The guy stopped the car and started shouting. I was at the end of the crossroad. I turned and faced him. I had no feelings. Neither good, nor bad. I was just so sure of myself.</p>

<p>The guy came to me, shouting, spreading his saliva all around. I asked him whether he knew how to drive a car. I affirmed he was a dickhead.</p>

<p>He threw a punch. For whatever reason, time slowed down. I grabbed his punch with my left hand, and his neck with the right.</p>

<p>And I threw him on the ground as strongly as I could.</p>

<p>I heard his skull crack.</p>

<p>He started screaming and crying.</p>

<p>I took him by the neck and, sliding him on the ground, brought him back to his car. I threw him inside, and told him to learn how to drive. I closed the door.</p>

<p>I wasn’t shaking. I wasn’t stressed, or excited. I had no feelings. I just felt that I did the right thing.</p>

<p>I turned around. Lots of people. Staring. Taking pictures, maybe videos. I stared back. I just felt I did the right thing.</p>

<p>Then I walked my way.</p>

<p>I didn’t feel happy, or sad, or excited, or strong. I just felt right.</p>

<p>And the incident was forever forgotten.</p>

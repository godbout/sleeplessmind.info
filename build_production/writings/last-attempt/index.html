    <h1>Last Attempt</h1>
    <p>It had been a long time since nothing like that happened.</p>

<p>The older I get, the less crazy I am. The older I get, the more I know that my time is counted. I've always known, but now I feel it, year after year. And also, it now takes me three days to recover. So...</p>

<p>But what do you do when you can't even stand going back to your own home? What do you do when you can't even let yourself being by yourself? What do you do when you need someone to protect you. From yourself?</p>

<p>Then you go out, to not be alone. Then you drink. And a bit more. You try to numb yourself. You try to seep under the bar of consciousness. It doesn't work. So you find something else. A pair of lips. A smile. A kiss. A hard cock in the toilet, trying to pee, being rubbed by someone who also risks a thumb in your ass. Nice try. But too early. A walk. A hand sliding down your panties. A rub. A cunt. A wet cunt. Some more alcohol. And water too. A shower. A blowjob. In what order? A cunt. An ass. In. Two asses. In. Explosions.</p>

<p>And the next day it's all but death.</p>

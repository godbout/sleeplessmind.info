    <h1>Hit and Run</h1>
    <p>I’m a responsible person. Or at least I usually try to be. But that day, I really ate shit. One of the saddest day of my life. So I gave myself a treat.</p>

<p>For whatever reason-that I deemed valid at the time-I drank. Heavily. And I drove back home. Me. The guy who would never do that.</p>

<p>I couldn’t get the car straight, sometimes I was running over the side path, but I didn’t give a shit. I was ok with being arrested tonight. I was ok with being considered a piece of shit. I’ve fought so many years to be seen as the good guy.</p>

<p>Then I hit something. A dog I think. I checked the rearview mirror, but couldn’t really see clearly. Anyway, I didn’t care.</p>

<p>Next think I know, I’m in front of my bed, and fall asleep like a baby&#46;..</p>

<p>The next day I go for my usual coffee, in my usual place, reading my usual newspaper.</p>

<p>Last night there was a hit and run. Someone hit a 7 years old kid and left the crime scene.</p>

<p>Can you believe it? How can people do that? It’s 2016 for God’s sake.</p>

<p>It happened close to where I was driving, around the same time.</p>

<p>If I hadn’t been drunk, I might have been able to see something, and help.</p>

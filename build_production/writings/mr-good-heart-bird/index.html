    <h1>Mr Good-Heart-Bird</h1>
    <p>There was a Bird in this Tree.<br />
A nice Bird. Quite common but still, with a nice Bird's heart.<br />
He flew for some hours, over the fields, over some trees, close to a village, to get some food for his 'descendance'.<br />
When He came back, the Tree was down.<br />
Some humans made it fall. They were still torturing Him.<br />
These humans found the Nest, with Mr Good-Heart-Bird's babies inside.<br />
When He came back, two were already dead, reduced to 2 dimensions by some human boots.<br />
He thought that maybe those human laughs and human smiles killed them also.<br />
The two others died in front of His small little eyes.<br />
In a couple of seconds, with a couple of humans, Mr Good-Heart-Bird lost everything.<br />
What else?<br />
He started crying. He knows there's nothing to do to get His loved ones back. He's full of feelings: sadness, hate, but also freedom. He really feels the freedom.<br />
He knows what He has to do.<br />
He goes down, very fast. He got His targets.<br />
Without understanding what's happening in this Bird's heart, mr i-squeeze-some-nice-birds-with-my-fucking-boots-and-laugh (also called fucking-asshole) lost one eye&#46;..</p>

<p>Mr Good-Heart-Bird is now lying on the ground. He has been beaten by fucking-asshole's friend.<br />
With a last effort, He made a fly-jump and is now surrounding his family, protecting them. He prays for the humans to squeeze him also.</p>

<p>1 second. Done.</p>

<p>Mr Good-Heart-Bird died happily. With beautiful tears in His eyes. fucking-asshole will remember him forever, and doesn't have another chance to laugh too loud.</p>

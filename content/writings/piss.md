I'm slowly opening my eyes, but they feel clamped together. What happened? My head is excruciatingly painful. I rummage through my hair but there is no trace of blood. I'm in the loo, but not mine. What the hell. I'm in a hotel. I remember being at the bar counter, drinking and talking to her. Then she turned her back to me and right in front of my face started flirting with another guy and I think I looked quite bewildered because she told me to fuck off. I gazed at her gaudy slacks, stood up and left. I heard her call my name so naturally I turned my head, and then I blacked out and now I'm lying down here in other people's piss. 

Life is strange. Life is savage.

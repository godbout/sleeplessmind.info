Why did I do that? I don’t know. 

I cared about her, but in some ways, it feels like I wanted to destroy her. And I did.

Not physically. At least, not primarily. But I pushed her emotionally. Very hard. Or did I?

I just told her the truth. I told her what I felt. I told her it didn’t make sense to keep wasting her time, and my time.

But she didn’t take it well.

Am I responsible? Should I have shut up instead, and pretend?

Should I lie to her and to myself?

For what good.

But she cut herself. And the whole bathroom became a scarlet floor.

Am I responsible?

Maybe. I don’t know. I don’t think so.

And the worst is that, I don’t even feel it..

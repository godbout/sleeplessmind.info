I'm walking. Snowing everywhere. Can't see my steps. It's grey. I'm in a storm. I feel death coming, but I am peaceful. Strangely, everything seems beautiful\... All is grey, lights are bright, the ground is white. There's animals around, probably bears. I can smell them. I'm trapped. I know. My death is coming. Very soon. And all I feel is peace. Gratefulness. And Love.

Am I really that fucked up?

I wish I had known sooner.

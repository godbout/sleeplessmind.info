My neighbor was long asleep already, and I was stuck against the  porthole. There was no view. All black. Just the incessant blinking of a green cricket under the aisle of the aircraft.

The guy next to me was fat, and his left leg kept rubbing against mine. All I wanted was to pee, but as soon as I was on top of him all I could think of was to puncture his stomach with a knife and peer at all that fat coming out like gelatin.

I passed him, and headed towards the back of the cabin.

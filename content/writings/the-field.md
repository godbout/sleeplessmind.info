All is calm  
I'm lying there  
The sun warming my face  
The wind  
Blows the barley  
Pushes the clouds  
The sky is so blue  
I have to squeeze my eyes  
I'm alone  
The senses  
On my skin  
On my arms  
I'm alive  
I can feel  
I am nature  
I am life  
And even if  
I hurt  
I cannot die  
By my own hand  
Yet

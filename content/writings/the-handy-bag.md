no  
no  
no i don't want to be here  
no, not now  
i'm tired, i'm tired  
i don't want this smoke, i don't want this smell  
what i'm gonna do?  
i want to escape, i want to escape  
and here she comes  
and here he is  
he's my way to the other world  

the handbag, the handy bag  

she opens it  
and i'm falling  
it's black  
it's black  
i'm afraid  
but i know that's where i want to go  
i have to fight  
the pressure  
is too high  
i'm gonna die  
but on the other side  
it's full of colors  
it's full of colors
